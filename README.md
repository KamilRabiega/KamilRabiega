Hello everyone, my name is Kamil Rabiega and I am a 4th year IT student at the University of Zielona GÃ³ra. 
I am currently working on my thesis project which topic is "Web application for managing a manufacturing enterprise". To develop this application I am using technologies such as ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, C#, MS SQL, Razor Pages, MVC, GIT. I am learning that for myself also to get a job in the future as C#/.Net/SQL developer.
